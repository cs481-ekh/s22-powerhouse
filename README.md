# For dev work: 
NodeJS will need to be installed to run and install the testing and linter.

The following instructions will get it set up for you. If you have any questions,
ask Jost / YeOldeGent: 

1. Download the latest version of NodeJS: 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Install with all dependencies. 

3. In VSCode, switch your terminal to bash from powershell. (while this may
not be absolutely neccesary, it will be simplest) 

4. In the terminal, run: 
```
./build.sh
```
Currently if nothing pops up, then you are good to go. If an error occurs,
then it must be fixed to finish the lint. 

5. To test your code with the unit tests, 
```
./test.sh
```
