### Sprint 0 Planning - Week 5
#### Attendees: Taylor Brooks, Jost Leavell, & Dawson Biersdorff
##### Notes
- Project plan comments were reviewed and the necessary changes were made. 
- Plan was sent over to Dr. Fologea along with any new questions for him. 
- Sprint 0 Planning was completed by making tasks/user stories in Github.
- Will use original program to ensure our new program is working properly. 
-- We know the current programs functionality is good.
##### Sprint 0 Goal
- By the end of this sprint we will be able to have a basic web application setup so we can seamlessly begin functionality work in sprint 1. We will also have our continuous integration, including build and test scripts, written by the end of it. 
##### Action Items
- Everyone: Have a basic html, javascript, and css project setup posted to Github to start work on in Sprint 1.
- Jost: Sections Setup github with yaml and CI. 
- Dawson: Sections Configure build script for CI.
- Taylor: Section Configure test script for CI.

### Week 4 Meeting 
#### Attendees: Taylor Brooks, Jost Leavell, & Dawson Biersdorff
##### Notes
- Worked on the Project Plan and divided the work for the week.
- Discussed the build and test scripts for CI.
-- Decided for now that linting in the build step and JS units tests in the test script. 
- Most likely will use Bootstrap CSS framework.
- We have found many JS graphing libraries that will work great. 
-- We also found a nice physics if we end up having any animation. 
- Discussed UX design. 
-- Think having the graph at the top and center of the app will make it more appealing. Maybe have tabs on the left for other equations in the future. 
##### Questions for Dr Fologea
- Does the graph still need the lines on the graph representing concentrations of each of the molecules?
##### Action Items
- Jost: Sections 1 and 2 done before due date. Setup github with yaml and CI.
- Dawson: Sections 4 and 5 done before due date. Configure build script for CI.
- Taylor: Section 3 done before due date. Configure test script for CI.

## 1/26/2022 10:30am - 11:15am
### First Proper Meeting - Week 3
#### Attendees: Taylor Brooks, Jost Leavell, & Dawson Biersdorff
##### Notes
- Agreed that GNU General Public License was a good way to keep the project source open through any iterations. 
- Worked on Team Contract. Details are in the document on the Drive. 
- Finished CONTRIBUTORS file in Github
##### Action Items
- All members work on Project Plan. 
- All memebers research ideas for build and test CI.

## 1/25/2022 2:30pm - 3:00pm 
### Sponsor Meeting Minutes
#### Attendees: Dr. Fologea, Taylor Brooks, Jost Leavell, & Dawson Biersdorff
##### Questions asked:
- What is priority with the app in terms of animations?
- If you are already using an application for this, what is that app missing or what do you want the new app to do that the old one can’t?
- How do you want the new app to look? Similar to the old one?
- Where will this app be used? Laptops, lab computers, desktops, phones…etc
- What license will need to be used?  
- General info about the math/science behind the app? 
- What is your goal with this app? Research, education, something else? 
##### Notes:
- Problem Statement: Having trouble distributing the current GHK Simulator to all students and systems. Not all systems can run the software easily and need prerequisites to run. Do not want flash to be required. Software also has more features than needed. Need only one formula and graph to help teach students. 
- Graph the most important aspect.
- Windows and Mac and okay for students to have to download something. 
- Distribution is the main problem as well as students not being able to run the current program.
- Publish on Github for everyone
- License is our decision
- axis: Y: +-100 X: 20-30 seconds 
- For Sliders: 
- 200 max for all concentrations
- Permeabilities have to go to up to 10,000
- No tooltips 
- Info about science in documentation
- No animation or the info in the bottom right corner of the example
##### Action Items
- Decide platform to develop on as a team (HTML, JS, & CSS, Java, Python,...).
- Taylor: Research JS graphing and libraries.
- Jost: Research licenses and what will work best for the team. 
- Dawson: Research improvements to UX and app in general.
