General info about the math/science behind the app?

Notes:
Problem Statement: Having trouble distributing the current GHK Simulator to all students and systems. Not all systems can run the software easily and need prerequisites to run. Do not want flash to be required. Software also has more features than needed. Need only one formula and graph to help teach students. 
Graph the most important aspect.
Windows and Mac and okay for students to have to download something. 
Distribution is the main problem as well as students not being able to run the current program.
Publish on Github for everyone
License is our decision
